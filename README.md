<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Features

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:
* mymui provides two tools for styling and building Material-UI components quickly and easily
* Theme Styler allows the customization of a Material-UI theme with a dynamic visual interface
* Adjust color, button styling, typography, and alerts with palettes, switches, sliders + more
* Download a custom theme and apply it to your project using Material-UI's ThemeProvider
* Save and share your theme with the mymui community
* Discover user created themes via the explore page
* Star and bookmark your favorite themes
* Grid Builder follows the 12 column grid system and visualizes how Material-UI structures grid layouts and positioning
* Drag, drop, and resize grid containers, and observe the code adjust in real-time

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.

## Project Challenges

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Grid Builder follows the 12 column grid system and visualizes how Material-UI structures grid layouts and positioning
* Drag, drop, and resize grid containers, and observe the code adjust in real-time
* Managing the number of props + state of the custom theme object throughout our application — more than four dozen parameters!
* Assigning the logic of change handlers to different selection tools within the design page
* Learning the functionality of a NoSQL database (Firestore), and the referencing of deeply nested objects
* Firebase data flow, integration of Firebase + Google Cloud functions, and how authentication interacts with database
* Implementing drag and drop functionality with vanilla Javascript rather than a library, and gaining an understanding of how implementation works under the hood
* Building social aspects ie. starring and bookmarking themes — capturing and storing interactions between users

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
